# Smart_PLL_Interface - Real Time-Control and Monitoring-GUI

**NDA-compliant educational release** of the framework designed for Z-Communications’ line of **Smart SSG PLL products**, providing a cross-compatible, Python-based GUI for serial control and monitoring.

---

### ⚙️ Overview
This project demonstrates the **core architecture** of a real-time GUI used to interface with MCU-controlled PLL synthesizers.  
The GUI layer runs asynchronously, handling command queues, serial polling, and sweep control while the MCU manages timing and RF loop operations.

---

### 🧩 Framework Highlights
- **Serial Communication:** auto-detect, safe connect/disconnect, non-blocking TX/RX  
- **Threaded Control Layer:** independent polling and sweep threads  
- **Synchronized Polling:** aligned with firmware timing; GUI never dictates pacing  
- **Sweep Engine:** range-based control with step/dwell parameters  
- **Crash-Safe:** graceful recovery from disconnects and timeouts  
- **Cross-Compatible:** supports multiple Smart PLL variants
